          always makes time for one another — to celebrate successes, share struggles, and grow together. It’s this
          emotional strength and foundation that shapes an individual's character, values, and resilience. For me, my

          inspire me every day. I feel immense respect for our soldiers — the true guardians of our freedom — who
          sacrifice their comfort and lives to protect our borders selflessly. Equally, I salute our farmers, the
          backbone of our country, who work tirelessly in all seasons to feed the nation. Their dedication, discipline,
